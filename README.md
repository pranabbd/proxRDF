This is a python code to calculate the proximal radial distribution function (pRDF or pG(r)) of a surface. 
Here, the code is used to analyze the molecular dynamics hydration data of a zwitterionic surface (polymer-brush). The surface
is made with a polymer chain of TMAO (pTMAO). The generated pG(r) for the pTMAO surface is published in the following JACS article.
